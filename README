--------------
What is this ?
--------------
Grim Mouse allows to play 'Grim Fandango' like a point-and-click adventure, 
instead of the original tank-style keyboard controls.
The mod is based on the ResidualVM game engine, which means it will also run on
Mac and Linux, not only on Windows as the original game.

* Important note *
Please note that as the game was never meant to be played using the mouse,
Grim Mouse heavily modifies both the game source code and the surrounding
VM-- Neither LucasArts nor the ResidualVM team will provide support for this
mod. See below for information on how to report bugs.

-------------
Current state
-------------
This mod is alpha, and has not been well tested yet. You may
run into bugs, which may prevent you from finishing the game --
so save often and play at your own risk.

---------------------
Installing Grim Mouse
---------------------
Installation of Grim Mouse works exactly like installation of ResidualVM.
In short:
1. Copy all the files in the 'grimdata' folder of both Grim Fandango CDs
   into a folder on your hard drive. Overwriting duplicate files is fine.
2. Download the original v1.1 patch (gfupd101.exe) from residualvm.org/downloads
   and put it into the same folder.
3. Extract the Grim Mouse package
   Mac: Drag the residualvm icon into /Applications
   Windows: Copy residualvm.exe and mouse.lab into any folder on your hard disk
4. Start Grim Mouse / ResidualVM
5. Click 'Add Game' and navigate to your gamedata folder from Step 1
   The screen should say "Grim Fandango Windows/English". That's ok, even
   if running it on Mac or Linux.
6. Click 'OK' and 'Start' -> you're all set.

If your have any problems installing, you may also consult the original
ResidualVM guide (residualvm.org) or README.ResidualVM, as the process is
the same.

--------
Controls
--------
Most of the keyboard controls still work in the original manner;
while the game should be playable 100% using the mouse only, if there are
some puzzles which you prefer to solve using the old interface, you can do so.

* New controls *
Left-click   : Walk and use 
               If you left-click on an object, it is used. If Manny
               is holding an inventory object, it is used on the scene object.
Double-click : Run and use
               Same as single-click, except Manny will run to the object.
Right-click  : Look at / Use inventory object on its own
               Same as left-click, except Manny will look at an object instead
               of using it. If Manny is holding an inventory object, right-click
               will use it on its own (e.g. deck of cards, or fire extinguisher
               in Beaver Dam)
Middle-click : Open Inventory
(or I key)     If Manny is holding an object, he will put it away.
               Left-click within the inventory selects an object, right-click
               will make Manny look at it.
Space key    : Show all hotspots in the scene
Shift + Z    : Toggle developer mode

* Useful old controls *
Alt+Enter    : Toggle fullscreen mode
Arrow keys   : Control Manny the old fashioned way
E,U,P,I      : Examine, Use, Pickup, Inventory
F1           : Menu (use arrow keys to navigate)
Escape       : Skip some cutscenes
.            : Skip dialogue lines

Troubleshooting
---------------
Bugs are to be expected. Please report your bugs in the github issue tracker
https://github.com/tobiaspfaff/grim_mouse/issues (preferred)
or by email (verticalduck (at) gmail.com) if you don't have a github account.

If you are stuck due to a bug and want to continue playing the game, you can try
using the old controls to manouver out of broken boxes, or activating the 
developer mode with Shift+Z and teleport into an adjacent scene etc. (Check 
README.ResidualVM for the developer mode shortcuts)
